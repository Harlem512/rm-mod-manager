# Legacy RMML Versions

This directory contains legacy (pre-6.0) versions of Rusted Moss Mod Loader. These are included for historical reasons and referencing, and should not be used.

These `.md` files get converted using a Python script into `.ini` mods. RMML 4.1 and 5.3 contain a second file, `rmml-X-src.meow`, which is a Catspeak source file containing the actual source code, and were named `rmml/rmml_src.meow`.
